# Planning Artifacts

This directory contains internal planning, execution, audit, and rollout artifacts.

## Layout

- `active/`: in-progress plans.
- `archive/`: completed plans.

## Rules

- Create new plan files under `docs/planning/active/`.
- Keep plans multi-stage with checkbox task lists and update status continuously.
- When a plan is fully complete, move it to `docs/planning/archive/` immediately.
