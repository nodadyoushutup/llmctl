# Custom MCP Integration Settings Future Note

Status: tentative

Goal: define a future approach so custom MCP servers can auto-apply integration settings without hardcoded backend-only mappings.

Brief scope note:
- Identify how custom MCP servers declare required integration types.
- Define validation rules for those integration requirements.
- Define how custom server integration mappings are configured and audited safely.
